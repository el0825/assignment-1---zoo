    Flamingos are striking wading birds recognized worldwide for their pink plumage, long legs,
    and uniquely bent bills. Their pink and red hues come from pigments called carotenoids in
    the algae and crustaceans they eat. Flamingos feed by filtering tiny organisms from the
    water, swinging their heads upside-down in a motion unlike any other bird. They are also
    highly social, forming colonies that can number in the thousands. During mating season,
    entire flocks perform synchronized “dance” displays to attract mates.
