      The lion is one of the most iconic big cats, known for its strength, social behavior, and majestic appearance. 
      Native to parts of Africa and a small population in India, lions are unique among cats because they live in groups called prides, which consist of related females, their cubs, and a few males. 
      Male lions are easily identified by their thick manes, which vary in color and size. As apex predators, lions hunt large herbivores such as zebras and wildebeest, often working cooperatively to bring down prey. 
      While once widespread, lion populations have declined significantly due to habitat loss, human conflict, and poaching, making conservation efforts vital to their survival.
