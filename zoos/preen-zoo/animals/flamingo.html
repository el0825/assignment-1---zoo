      Flamingos are tall, pink wading birds famous for their long legs, S-shaped necks,
      and habit of standing on one leg. Their bright pink color comes from carotenoid
      pigments in the food they eat, like shrimp and algae. Flamingos live in large
      flocks near shallow lakes and lagoons, where they filter-feed for food.
