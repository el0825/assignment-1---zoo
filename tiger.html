      The tiger is the largest species of the cat family and is renowned for its striking orange coat with black stripes. 
      Native to Asia, tigers are powerful solitary hunters that rely on stealth and strength to ambush prey such as deer and wild boar. 
      They are strong swimmers and often cool off or hunt near rivers and lakes, unlike most other big cats. Each tiger has a unique stripe pattern, much like a fingerprint, which helps researchers identify individuals. 
      Unfortunately, tigers are endangered due to poaching and habitat loss, with fewer than 5,000 left in the wild, making their conservation a global priority.
