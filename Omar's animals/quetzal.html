      The resplendent quetzal is one of the most beautiful birds of Mesoamerica, admired for its vibrant green and red feathers and long flowing tail. In ancient Mexico, the quetzal held deep cultural and spiritual significance, often associated with the god Quetzalcoatl, the “feathered serpent.” Its feathers were considered precious and were used to adorn the headdresses of Aztec and Maya royalty. Today, quetzals are found in cloud forests across southern Mexico and Central America, where they feed on fruits like avocados and play an important role in seed dispersal. The quetzal remains a symbol of freedom and natural beauty, celebrated in Mexican art, folklore, and conservation efforts.
