        Sheep are domesticated animals that have been raised by humans for thousands of years, primarily for their wool, meat (lamb and mutton), and milk. 
        They are social herd animals that graze on grasses and are well adapted to a wide range of climates and terrains. 
        Sheep play an important role in agriculture worldwide, with their wool being a major natural fiber used in textiles. 
        They also contribute to land management by controlling vegetation growth. Known for their strong flocking instinct, sheep rely on group behavior for protection from predators.
