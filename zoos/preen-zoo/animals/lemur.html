    Lemurs are primates found only on the island of Madagascar. They are famous for their large,
    expressive eyes and long, bushy tails used for balance and communication. Lemurs live in
    social groups, and many species are led by females—a rare trait among primates. They are
    active both day and night depending on the species, and their diets vary from fruit and
    leaves to nectar and insects. Sadly, many lemur species are endangered due to deforestation
    and habitat loss, making them important ambassadors for conservation efforts.
