  <p>
    Koalas are marsupials native to eastern Australia, instantly recognizable by their round
    faces, fluffy ears, and spoon-shaped noses. Despite being called “koala bears,” they are
    not bears at all. Koalas feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in
    nutrition and require a specialized digestive system to detoxify. Because of this poor-energy
    diet, koalas spend up to 20 hours each day sleeping or resting in the branches of eucalyptus
    trees. They play an important ecological role by pruning trees and spreading nutrients
    through their droppings.
