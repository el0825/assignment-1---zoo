      The red panda is a small, tree-dwelling mammal native to the forests of the Himalayas and southwestern China. 
      Despite its name, it is not closely related to the giant panda but shares a similar diet, feeding mainly on bamboo along with fruits, berries, and small insects. 
      Red pandas are easily recognized by their reddish-brown fur, bushy striped tails, and playful appearance. 
      They are mostly solitary, active at dawn and dusk, and skilled climbers that spend much of their time in trees. 
      Sadly, red pandas are classified as endangered due to habitat loss, deforestation, and poaching, with fewer than 10,000 estimated to remain in the wild.
