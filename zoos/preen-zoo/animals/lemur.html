      Lemurs are primates native to Madagascar and are famous for their large,
      expressive eyes and long, bushy tails. They are highly social animals
      that live in groups called troops. Lemurs are active both during the day
      and night, depending on the species, and their diet includes fruits,
      leaves, and insects. Sadly, many lemur species are endangered due to
      deforestation and habitat loss, making them one of the worldâ€™s most
      threatened groups of mammals.
