      Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their round, fluffy ears
      and button-like noses. They spend most of their lives in eucalyptus trees,
      feeding almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves. Koalas sleep up to 18â€“20 hours
      a day to conserve energy because their diet is low in nutrition. Though often
      called "koala bears," they are not bears but marsupials that carry their young
      in a pouch.
