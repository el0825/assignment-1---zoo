      The axolotl, often called the "Mexican walking fish," is a unique salamander native to lakes near Mexico City. Unlike most amphibians, axolotls remain aquatic throughout their lives and keep their feathery external gills, giving them a distinctive appearance. They are known for their incredible ability to regenerate entire limbs, spinal cord, and even parts of their heart and brain, which has made them an important subject of scientific research. In the wild, axolotls are critically endangered due to habitat loss and pollution, but they are commonly bred in captivity as pets and for study.
