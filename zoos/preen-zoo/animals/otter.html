  <p>
    Otters are energetic, semi-aquatic mammals that spend much of their time in the water.
    They use their sleek, streamlined bodies and strong tails to swim with speed and grace.
    Otters are known for their intelligence and playful behavior, often sliding on riverbanks,
    juggling small stones, or floating together in groups called “rafts.” Their dense fur is
    one of the warmest in the animal kingdom, protecting them from cold waters. They play a
    vital role in freshwater and coastal ecosystems by controlling fish and invertebrate
    populations.
