      Coatis, or coatimundis, are common in the forests and mountains of Mexico, especially in regions like the Yucatán Peninsula and the Sierra Madre. These curious mammals are often spotted in national parks and Mayan ruins, where they forage for fruit, insects, and small animals. With their long striped tails and flexible snouts, coatis are easy to recognize, and they often travel in playful groups called bands. In Mexican culture, they are a familiar sight to hikers and travelers, blending into the country’s rich biodiversity alongside jaguars, quetzals, and other iconic wildlife.
